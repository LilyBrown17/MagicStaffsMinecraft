# Overview

This project is a set of Minecraft plugins that add several magical staffs able to fire special projectiles such as Wind Charges, Fire Charges, and Ender Pearls. Each item has its own custom model and textures, as well as crafting recipes. All of the items work as intended and so far have no adverse effects on the game itself.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used IntelliJ Idea, Blockbench, VSCode, Photopea, and Minecraft itself in order to create this project.

Programming was done with Java and Json, and several Mincraft-specific libraries and imports were added.
